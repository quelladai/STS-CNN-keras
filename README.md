# STS-CNN-keras

The Keras implementation of "Missing Data Reconstruction in Remote Sensing Image With a Unified Spatial–Temporal–Spectral Deep Convolutional Neural Network", https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8316243.

It is just an unofficial pytorch implementation of the paper, i just finish it but didn't test the result.

Python 3.6
Keras 2.2.0
Tensorflow 1.8

The file 'model.py' is the model in the paper.
